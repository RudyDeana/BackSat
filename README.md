# 🌐 BackSat - The Backpack Satellite

**BackSat** is an open-source project that transforms any compatible device into an independent communication node — without SIM cards, cell towers, or internet.

Think of it as a **terrestrial satellite in your backpack**. It creates secure offline networks that work in blackouts, disasters, or remote missions.
